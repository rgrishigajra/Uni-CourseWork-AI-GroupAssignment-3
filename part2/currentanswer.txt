equal station to which the aws of ature and of atures od entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation e hold these truths to ve selfebident that all men are created equal that they are endowed vy their reator with certain unalienavle ights that among these are ife iverty and the pursuit of appinesshat to secure these rights obernments are instituted among en deribing their just powers from the consent of the goberned hat wheneber any orm of obernment vecomes destructibe of these ends it is the ight of the eople to alter or to avolish it and to institute new obernment laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their afety and appiness rudence indeed will dictate that obernments long estavlished should not ve changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while ebils are sufferavle than to right themselbes vy avolishing the forms to which they are accustomed ut when a long train of avuses and usurpations pursuing inbariavly the same vject ebinces a design to reduce them under avsolute espotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such obernment and to probide new uards for their future securityuch has veen the patient
