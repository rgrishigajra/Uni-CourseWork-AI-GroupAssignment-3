Test Outputs for files encrypted-text-1.txt is output1.txt, ecrypted-text-2.txt is output2.txt and so on. Each was run with 10 minute limit. I also added a prop.txt file which was not encrypted to test how the code deals with such files, and it doesnt change the input file at all since its already English like. 
Probab.txt is the dictionary of frequencies and the probabilities I am using to calculate the probability of the file.
